I would want to tell you how to create functions in postgreSQL.

A stored procedure and user-defined function (UDF) is a set of SQL and procedural statements 
(declarations, assignments, loops, flow-of-control etc.) that stored on the database server and can be invoked using the SQL interface.

In PostgreSQL, both stored procedures and user-defined functions are created with CREATE FUNCTION statement. 
There are differences between the notion of stored procedures and functions in database system
